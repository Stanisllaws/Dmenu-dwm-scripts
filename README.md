# Dmenu-dwm-scripts
Thoes scripts can be use in dwm/config.h for launching the programes using dwm. I can be use if have use for example you'll like to use let's mod + w for launching browsers, if you have more then one browser I give nice gui manu selection with keeping it minimal with the Suckless philosophy.

1.How to use it : git clone:
2. $ sudo chmod +x st-chromium.sh
3.then diclear it in ~/dwm/config.h
like for example 
static const char *menusmd[]  = { "   st-chromium.sh ", NULL };
